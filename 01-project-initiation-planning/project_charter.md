- Enable dynamic selection of print information based on customer requirements
- Maintain integration with Hertwich laser printing system
- Support various customer-specific data combinations

## 3. Project Scope

### In Scope:
- Customer-specific layout configuration management
- Data field selection and management (logo, company name, charge number, alloy number, QR code, etc.)
- Integration interface with Hertwich laser printing system
- Configuration for customer-specific requirements

### Out of Scope:
- Modifications to Hertwich laser printing hardware
