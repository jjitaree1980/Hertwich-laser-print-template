## 1. Executive Summary

This business case justifies the investment in developing a customer-specific laser print layout management system for aluminum billet marking. The current system lacks flexibility to accommodate varying customer requirements for laser print information, leading to manual workarounds and potential production errors.

## 2. Business Problem/Opportunity

### Current Situation
- Production team manually manages different laser print requirements for different customers
- No systematic way to control layout printing by customer in Kubal system
- Each customer has unique requirements for billet marking information
- Risk of printing incorrect information leading to customer dissatisfaction

### Business Opportunity
- Automate customer-specific layout selection
- Reduce manual intervention and errors
- Improve customer satisfaction through accurate, customized marking
- Enable scalable solution for growing customer base with diverse requirements

## 3. Business Objectives

1. **Operational Efficiency:** Reduce manual configuration time by 70%
2. **Quality Improvement:** Eliminate layout errors in laser printing
3. **Customer Satisfaction:** Deliver customer-specific marking requirements accurately
4. **Scalability:** Support unlimited customer-specific configurations

## 4. Current State Analysis

### Existing Process
1. Production team receives order
2. Manually checks customer requirements
3. Prepares data for Hertwich system
4. Manual verification of layout compliance

### Pain Points
- Time-consuming manual process
- Potential for human error
- No standardized approach
- Difficult to onboard new customers with unique requirements
- No audit trail of layout changes

## 5. Proposed Solution

Implement a customer flag/configuration system within Kubal that:
- Stores customer-specific layout templates
- Automatically selects appropriate layout based on customer order
- Maintains integration with Hertwich laser printing system
- Provides configuration interface for new customer requirements

### Solution Components
1. Customer configuration database
2. Layout template management module
3. Dynamic data field selector
4. Integration layer with Hertwich system

## 6. Benefits Analysis

### Quantifiable Benefits
- **Time Savings:** Estimated 30 minutes per batch × 50 batches/week = 25 hours/week
- **Error Reduction:** Eliminate ~10 layout errors per month
- **Customer Service:** Faster onboarding of new customers with specific requirements

### Non-Quantifiable Benefits
- Improved production team morale (less manual work)
- Enhanced company reputation for quality
- Better customer relationships
- Future-proof solution for expanding customer base

- **Cons:** Ongoing inefficiency, error risk, not scalable
- **Recommendation:** Not viable long-term

### Alternative 2: Third-Party Solution
- **Pros:** Faster implementation
- **Cons:** Integration challenges, ongoing licensing costs, less customization
- **Recommendation:** Not suitable for specific integration needs

### Alternative 3: Recommended Solution
- Custom development in Kubal system
- **Pros:** Full control, optimal integration, tailored to needs
- **Cons:** Development time and cost
- **Recommendation:** Best long-term solution

## 11. Success Criteria

1. System successfully manages layouts for all current customers
2. Zero layout errors in first 3 months post-implementation
3. New customer configuration completed in < 30 minutes
4. Production team satisfaction rating > 4.5/5
5. Successful integration with Hertwich system (100% data transmission accuracy)
